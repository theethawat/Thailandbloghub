**Fail Projects**


### Motivation

Thailand blogger community in 2009-2012 we had **Thailand Blog Award** that it was a place that I and other people can share their own blog or website whatever get or not get prize from the award but the platfrom for voting blog can make blog had seen by many people. Thailand Blog Hub project in early 2018 was released to make it to be again.

### What make it fail?

### Bad Requirement Survey

Since I thinking about it I take a research for requirement only in one day with Google Form in My own Facebook and my Facebook page.I get only 4 answers that I think it only from my friends but I want to continues my work.It is the bad thing that make this to be fail project the research is not enough for making this project and I only search on people who have a personal blog
